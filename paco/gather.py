    """
    Return a future aggregating results from the given coroutine objects
    with a concurrency execution limit.

    If all the tasks are done successfully, the returned futureâ€™s result is
    the list of results (in the order of the original sequence,
    not necessarily the order of results arrival).

    If return_exceptions is `True`, exceptions in the tasks are treated the
    same as successful results, and gathered in the result list; otherwise,
    the first raised exception will be immediately propagated to the
    returned future.

    All futures must share the same event loop.

    This functions is mostly compatible with Python standard
    ``asyncio.gather``, but providing ordered results and concurrency control
    flow.

    This function is a coroutine.

    Arguments:
        *coros_or_futures (coroutines|list): an iterable collection yielding
            coroutines functions or futures.
        limit (int): max concurrency limit. Use ``0`` for no limit.
        timeout can be used to control the maximum number
            of seconds to wait before returning. timeout can be an int or
            float. If timeout is not specified or None, there is no limit to
            the wait time.
        preserve_order (bool): preserves results order.
        return_exceptions (bool): returns exceptions as valid results.
        loop (asyncio.BaseEventLoop): optional event loop to use.

    Returns:
        list: coroutines returned results.

    Usage::

        async def sum(x, y):
            return x + y

        await paco.gather(
            sum(1, 2),
            sum(None, 'str'),
            return_exceptions=True)
        # => [3, TypeError("unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'str'")]  # noqa
