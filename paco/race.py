@asyncio.coroutine
def race(iterable, loop=None, timeout=None, *args, **kw):
    """
    Runs coroutines from a given iterable concurrently without waiting until
    the previous one has completed.

    Once any of the tasks completes, the main coroutine
    is immediately resolved, yielding the first resolved value.

    All coroutines will be executed in the same loop.

    This function is a coroutine.

    Arguments:
        iterable (iterable): an iterable collection yielding
            coroutines functions or coroutine objects.
        *args (mixed): mixed variadic arguments to pass to coroutines.
        loop (asyncio.BaseEventLoop): optional event loop to use.
        timeout (int|float): timeout can be used to control the maximum number
            of seconds to wait before returning. timeout can be an int or
            float. If timeout is not specified or None, there is no limit to
            the wait time.
        *args (mixed): optional variadic argument to pass to coroutine
            function, if provided.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if ``iterable`` argument is not iterable.
        asyncio.TimoutError: if wait timeout is exceeded.

    Returns:
        filtered values (list): ordered list of resultant values.

    Usage::

        async def coro1():
            await asyncio.sleep(2)
            return 1

        async def coro2():
            return 2

        async def coro3():
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
            return 3

        await paco.race([coro1, coro2, coro3])
        # => 2
